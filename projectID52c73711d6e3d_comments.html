<HTML><BODY>A travelogue from the Kingdom of Georgia, which clearly is not the US state, but the Iberian country... (Iberian also being a highly confusing name, as in this case it does not refer to the Iberian peninsula, but the ancient country in the Caucasus).

<p>No difficulties expected. In the table with the Georgian alphabet you can just type # for each of the Georgian letters.

<p>Have fun!
